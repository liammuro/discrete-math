### Monday Task

Hello my lovely students,

I will be gone on Monday, so Iâ€™m going to give you a video to watch and have you prove the following by induction:

See you on Tuesday!

## Discrete Classwork

Given:
$\phi(p^k) = p^k(1 - {{1}\over{p_1}})$

Prove the following by induction:

$\phi(n) = n(1 - {{1} \over {p_1}}) (1 - {{1} \over {p_2}}) \dots (1 - {{1} \over {p_m}})$ where $p_i$ are distinct primes from the prime factorization of $n$.
