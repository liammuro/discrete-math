 * The cube, 41063625 (3453), can be permuted to produce two other cubes: 56623104 (3843) and 66430125 (4053). 
 * In fact, 41063625 is the smallest cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube.
 * 
 * Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits are cube.
