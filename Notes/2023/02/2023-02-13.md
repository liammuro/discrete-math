### GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR

Def Let $a,b \in \Z$. We call an int $d$ the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ provided that:

- $d$ is a common factor of $a$ and $b$
  - $d|a$ and $d|b$
- if $e$ is also a common factor, then $e \le d$
- $\forall e \in \Z, e|a$ and $a|b \implies e \le d$
- \* $\gcd(a,b) = d$

### Euclid's Algorithm

Prop: Let $a,b \in \Z^+$ and let $c = (a \bmod b)$

then:
$\begin{aligned} &\gcd(a,b) = \gcd(b,c), \\
&\gcd(a,b) = \gcd(b, a \bmod b)\end{aligned}$

Proof: Given $c = a \bmod b$ i.e. $a = qb + c, q \in \Z, o \le c < b$

$d = \gcd(a,b), e = \gcd(b,c)$ \
We want to show $d \le e, d \ge e$

Show $d \le e$:

- Def: We know that $d|a$ and $d|b$
- Def rearrange: $c = a-qb$
- Conclusion: $c$ is a multiple of $d \implies d$ is a common factor of $b$ and $c \implies d \le e$

Show $d \ge e$:

- $e = \gcd(b,c)$
- $a = qb + c$
- $\implies e|a$ bc $e|b$ and $e|c \implies d \ge e$

We have shown $d \ge e, d \le e \therefore d = e \implies \gcd(a,b) = \gcd(b,c)$
