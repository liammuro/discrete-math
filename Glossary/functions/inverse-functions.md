# Inverse Functions

Given $f:A \rightarrow B$, then we define the <u>inverse</u> as $f^{-1}:B \rightarrow A$ iff $f$ is [injective](/Glossary/functions/injective-functions.md) and [surjective](/Glossary/functions/surjective-functions.md). 

$A$ and $B$ are sets. Inverse relation $f: A \rightarrow B$ only happens ouf there is a bijection
