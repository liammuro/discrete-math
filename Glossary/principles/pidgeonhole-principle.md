# Pidgeonhole Principle

Let $A$ and $B$ be finite sets and let $f: A \rightarrow B$. If $|A| > |B|$ then it is not [injective](/Glossary/functions/injective-functions.md). If $|A| < |B|$ then it is not [surjective](/Glossary/functions/surjective-functions.md)

___

ex. Let $|A| = 4, |B| = 6$
a. How many functions $f: A \rightarrow B$ are there? \
$|B|^{|A|} = 6^4 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 $

b. How many are [injective](/Glossary/functions/injective-functions.md)? \
$|B|_{|A|} = 6_4 = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3$

c. How many are [surjective](/Glossary/functions/surjective-functions.md)?
